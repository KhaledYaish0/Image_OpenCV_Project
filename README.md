- Implement the component labeling algorithm.
- Modify the component labeling algorithm to consider the 8-connectivity.
- Modify the component labeling algorithm to consider a range of intensity values within the set V, where V={min-max}, to determine pixel connectivity.
- The values of min and max are user-input parameters.
- Implement the size filter algorithm.
